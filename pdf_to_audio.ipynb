            "When best software architecture practices are not prioritized, there is often a natural\n",
            "pressure for faster deliveries, leading to low-quality architectural design. This, in turn, can\n",
            "result in poorly designed components, such as those with low modularity, high coupling, and\n",
            "low cohesion (BROWN et al. , 2010), (LI et al. , 2014), (MARTINI et al. , 2015), (TOLEDO\n",
            "et al. , 2021a). This phenomenon is commonly known as Architectural Technical Debt (ATD)\n",
            "(BESKER et al. , 2018). The occurrence and accumulation of ATD in complex software systems\n",
            "can increase maintenance efforts and make system evolution more challenging in the long term,\n",
            "ultimately hindering future development activities (KRUCHTEN et al. , 2019).\n",
            "Many software projects do not prioritize the identification and monitoring of Archi-\n",

            "permeate various stages and artifacts of the software development cycle (BESKER et al. , 2017a).\n",
            "The accumulation of ATD can lead to more significant maintenance efforts, such as higher\n",
            "bug-fix costs, more substantial efforts to add new features, and increased efforts to maintain\n",
            "existing features (TOLEDO et al. , 2021b), (XIAO et al. , 2021). Over time, this can result in\n",
            "excessive expenditures on software maintenance efforts and even lead to software bankruptcy\n",
            "(ALFAYEZ et al. , 2018).\n",
            "In our research, we examined the recurrent effort required to maintain source code\n",
            "artifacts over time in software repositories. Specifically, we considered architectural issues\n",
            "related to architectural smells and software metrics, such as lines of code (LOC) changes,\n",
            "cyclomatic complexity, and the occurrence of files in commits over time. It is important to\n",
